## About Me

Hi, I'm Vinutha Naik. Passionately advancing at the nexus of AI and web development, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Application from Karnataka University, specializing in Computer and Information Sciences. Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and Advanced Python Projects, my focus lies in machine learning, Python programming, and AI applications.

## Projects

### Personal Blog Website
Create a responsive personal blog website where users can read articles, share their thoughts, and interact with other users. The website features user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can browse articles by category, search for specific topics, and leave comments on posts. The admin panel allows administrators to manage users, articles, and comments.

### Task Management Application
Build a task management application to help users organize their tasks, set deadlines, and track progress. Users can create tasks, assign categories and priorities, and schedule due dates. The application includes user authentication for secure access and data privacy. Users can view their tasks in a list or calendar view, receive notifications for upcoming deadlines, and collaborate with team members.

### E-commerce Website
Develop a fully functional e-commerce website where users can browse products, add items to their cart, and securely make purchases. The website includes user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. Products are categorized and can be filtered by price, brand, and other attributes. The checkout process is seamless and secure, with multiple payment options available.
